# Theia

Theia is a sentiment analysis tool that uses voice and face recognition to analyze a person's feelings. It can be used to help businesses understand customer sentiment, or to analyze how employees are feeling. Theia can be used to monitor customer sentiment in real-time, or to analyze historical data to understand customer sentiment over time. It can also be used to understand how employees are feeling, and to identify potential issues early.

Theia is easy to use - simply install the software and point your camera at a person's face. Theia will analyze the person's facial expressions and voice to generate a sentiment score. The score will range from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive), with 0 being neutral. Theia can also generate a report that includes a breakdown of the person's sentiment by different emotions.

Theia is accurate and reliable, and has been validated against ground truth data. Theia is also private and secure, and does not store any personally identifiable information.

Theia can be used by businesses to understand customer sentiment, or by individuals to better understand their own emotions. Theia is the perfect tool for anyone who wants to better understand their emotions, or the emotions of others.
